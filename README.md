# Predictive-Maintainance-using-ML

* The Predictive Maintanance is based on the Machine Learning Algorithms. In this method, the sensors are mounted onthe various machine and assets to monitor the machine conditions. The collected data is sent to the Cloud where it is analysed and the predictions regarding Remaining Useful Life and the Time Frame of machine failure is predicted.
*Developed in HTML,Javascript for front end and Python using flask framework for backend.
